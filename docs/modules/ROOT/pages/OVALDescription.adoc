With virtual homologation in mind, we build a platform, OVAL, that can be used for secure data exchange across industries.

OVAL is based on the Ocean protocol and offers the data providers a way to lend their data by selling the access rights to it instead of the data itself.

It empowers OEMs to validate their driving functions and assists suppliers to validate their simulation models using the models and datasets available on the OVAL platform while keeping the functions and models within their premise.
